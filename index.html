                I will be graduating in the 2022-2023 school year. After reading a description about computer science, I became interested in the subject. I hope doing this class will eventually give me an opportunity to find out if I would do anything like this for my career or help me move into a path that would be helpful after college.

    <h2> Video Game Design Project</h2>
    
    <h3> Description </h3>
    <p> Our group had to create a video game that had to be able to teach people. We made a math game for ages 7+. In our game, players will be able to:
    </br>
    </br>
- Solve equations in different ways
</br>
</br>
- Earn coins to purchase cosmetics in order to make each players' experience unique to themselves
</p>
</br>
<h3> Design and Production Process:</h3>

<p> 1. Thought of different games that are enjoyed by all ages.</p>
<p> 2. Researched well known games </p>
<p> 3. Created mockups of the game </p>

<h3> Reflection</h3>
<p> After doing this project, I learned about:
    </br>
- How to work with people
</br>
- Researching games that are played by all age ranges
</br>
- Think of different ways to create a game </br></p>
